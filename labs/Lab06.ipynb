    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As shown in the figure, this would mean finding the lengths, $\\ell_i$, and angles, $\\theta_i$, for the springs given the spring constants $k_i$, the natural lengths of the spring $\\ell_{0i}$, and the masses $m_j$. This is six quantities to determine. However, this is a perilous path to follow. Though quite educational, if we used this approach we would find it requires more work and that the \"naive\" implementation leads to an incorrect solution! Unfortunately we do not have time to pursue this (as previous students have done). Instead, we will jump to a better approach: use vectors. As we will continue to learn in our physics career, writing things in terms of vectors (and matrices) is far simpler.\n",

Our objective is to find these $\\vec{r}_j$ given $\\vec{R}_j$, and the same parameters for the springs, $k_i$, and the masses, $m_j$. The red arrows in the figure represent the length vectors for the springs, $\\vec\\ell_i$. Notice that now we are only solving for the positions of the masses. This means solving for four quantities, not six! We thus only need four equations, all of which come from Newton's second law.\n",

    "### Problem Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this system we first need to know exactly what problem we want to solve. Vaguely it is to determine the static configuration. It is worth thinking about what that means for yourself. For the lab we will clearly specify the system along with what input will be given and what output is to be produced. You will be \"guided\" on how to think about and set up this problem. That does not mean this will be the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving a problem we should try to be as general as possible. Rarely are we really interesting in the exact problem given, instead we are interested in a class of problems and would like to be able to solve any in that class. In this case we could imagine many generalizations to the system shown in the figure. We could allow for many changes.\n",
    "1. Arbitrary number of masses.\n",
    "2. Arbitrary number of connecting springs to each mass.\n",
    "3. Arbitrary number of support points.\n",
    "4. Three dimensional configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Problem Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "We should include generalizations in our code if they do not make the solution significantly more complicated. For this lab you do not need to include such generalizations, but you should think about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our problem will be: given two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, connected by three springs with spring constants $k_1$, $k_2$, and $k_3$ and natural lengths $\\ell_{0,1}$, $\\ell_{0,2}$, and $\\ell_{0,3}$ at two support points separated by a distance $d$, determine the locations of the two masses $(x_j, y_j)$, in the static configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dimensionless Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, before proceeding we can do more than that. As is almost always the case we need to worry about units. Yet units should not matter. In fact, in the problem given does it matter if the distance between the support points is 1 cm, 1 meter, 1 mile, *etc.*? No! In general it is always best to work in terms of dimensionless quantities, that is, quantities that are relative to each other. In this case we really do not care what $d$ is, all we really care about is how all the lengths in this system compare to $d$. This means we can think of measuring all lengths in units of $d$, or equivalently that we will specify the natural lengths as the ratio $\\ell_{0,i}/d$ and find the locations of the masses in units of $d$, e.g., $x_j/d$, as our solution. Effectively this means that we can \"just set\" $d=1$ and when we say, for example, that $\\ell_{0,1}=1.5$ we mean that $\\ell_{0,1}=1.5 d$. Similarly it is convenient to specify the masses in terms of some mass unit, it really does not matter what it is. Let us call this mass $M$. We will thus always specify things as a ratio of masses. To make this more clear let us define $\\mu_j \\equiv m_j/M$. Finally, instead of specifying the spring constants in some units we can normalize them with this mass scale too by defining $\\kappa_i \\equiv \\frac{k_i d}{M g}$, where $g$ is the gravitational constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Problem Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "The new statement of our problem is as follows. Given two normalize masses, $\\mu_j$, and three springs with normalized spring constants, $\\kappa_i$, and natural lengths, $\\ell_{0,i}$ in units of $d$, determine in the static configuration the positions of the two masses $(x_j, y_j)$ in units of $d$."

In writing such a generic implementation, we allow for the specification of the desired convergence tolerances (absolute in `atol` and relative in `rtol`).
