    "\n",
    "The prelab is completed, however, if you would like to know about dealing with dates and times read on.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, dates and times are challenging to deal with computationally. There are so many different ways in which they are written and stored. For example, what date is 02/05/20? Is this mm/dd/yy or dd/mm/yy and is the year 1920, 2020, ....? In addition to this, if I tell you the prelab is due at 8:00 AM, in what timezone am I setting the time? (Yes, Canvas handles timezones correctly, so, yes, this means in the local timezone, and, no, this is not a loop hole you can exploit!) When specifying times and dates a consistent and coherent convention must be used. Fortunately there are standards. Unfortunately there are standards, plural.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timezones make things even more complicated. Daylight savings time (or really daylight ruining time) makes things worse as it ties the time and timezone to the date. Thus, if you want to know how much time it is until some event on some date in some location you need to know the time it is now in your location in your local timezone and compare it to the time at the location of the event which may be in a different timezone and may or may not be corrected for a daylight savings shift. To deal with this the correct thing to do is convert everything to Coordinated Universal Time (abbreviated UTC). This is a consistent date-time that does not have shifts due to daylight savings. (I will not go into leap seconds, that is a whole different issue.) Intelligent systems store times in UTC and then shift to any other timezone, as needed. (At least one very poorly designed operating system stores the time in your local timezone instead of UTC. I cannot even begin to imagine how anyone thought that was an idea, let alone a good idea.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The seismic data we are using stores times in UTC, as it should. Further, the first column of the data file is in a standard format, so can easily be parsed (by both humans and the computer). The `datetime` module in Python can convert it to a `datetime` object which can then be manipulated. NumPy also has the `np.datetime64` type which is understood by `matplotlib` and can be used for plotting. Unfortunately, `np.datetime64` does not handle timezones. Thus, if we really want to do things ourselves, we should read in the date-times into Python, do whatever manipulations we want, then convert them to `np.datetime64` for further processing. Alternatively, just use Pandas and let it deal these issues!\n",
